            <h3>Why Use Arrays?</h3>
            <p>If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables
                could look like this:
                However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3
                cars, but 300?

                The solution is an array!

                An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an
                index number.


                <p>JavaScript Array is a single variable that is used to store elements of different data types. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed. The Javascript Arrays are not associative in nature.

                    Arrays are used when we have a list of items. An array allows you to store several values with the same name and access them by using their index number.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is one of the most important scripting languages that is used mainly for improving a user’s interaction with a web page. With this programming language, you can make your website more lively, robust, and interactive. Today, JavaScript is being used widely in game development and mobile application development. It is one of the most popular langages used by software developers in their field of study and use.</p>

            <h3>JS Boolean</h3>
            <p>Boolean is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false. In JavaScript, Boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions, etc. in terms of true or false.

                Note: A variable or object which has a value is treated as a true boolean value. ‘0’, ‘NaN’, empty string, ‘undefined’, and ‘null’ is treated as false boolean values. 
                
                Here a1 and a2 store the boolean value i.e. true and false respectively. 


                <p>JBoolean() function in JavaScript: Boolean function returns the boolean value of the variable. It can also be used to find the boolean result of a condition, expression, etc.
